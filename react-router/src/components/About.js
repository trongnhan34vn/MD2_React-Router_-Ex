                                "Always be a little vague and keep them guessing." Her sister listened
                                intently and nodded in agreement. She didn't fully understand what her
                                sister was saying but that didn't matter. She loved her so much that
                                she would have agreed to whatever came out of her mouth.

                                answers anymore. The answers were always the same. Well, not exactly
                                the same, but the same in a general sense. A more accurate description
                                was the answers never surprised her. So, she asked for the 10,000th
                                time, "What's your favorite animal?" But this time was different. When
                                she heard the young boy's answer, she wondered if she had heard him
                                correctly.
