                            I inadvertently went to See's Candy last week (I was in the mall
                            looking for phone repair), and as it turns out, See's Candy now
                            charges a dollar -- a full dollar -- for even the simplest of their
                            wee confection offerings. I bought two chocolate lollipops and two
                            chocolate-caramel-almond things. The total cost was four-something. I
                            mean, the candies were tasty and all, but let's be real: A Snickers
                            bar is fifty cents. After this dollar-per-candy revelation, I may not
                            find myself wandering dreamily back into a See's Candy any time soon.

                            The choice was red, green, or blue. It didn't seem like an important
                            choice when he was making it, but it was a choice nonetheless. Had he
                            known the consequences at that time, he would likely have considered
                            the choice a bit longer. In the end, he didn't and ended up choosing
                            blue.
