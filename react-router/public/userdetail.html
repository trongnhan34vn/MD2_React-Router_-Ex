                    <p>The coin hovered in the air, spinning over and over again. It reached its peak and began to
                        descend. Both boys were pleading with it to land a certain way but the coin had already made up
                        its mind on what it was going to do.</p>
                    <p>The drug seekers would come into the emergency room and scream about how much pain they were in.
                        When you told them that you would start elevating their pain with Tylenol or Advil instead of a
                        narcotic they became nasty and combative. They would start telling you what drug and dose they
                        had to have to make their pain tolerable. After dealing with the same drug seekers several times
                        a month it gets old. Some of the doctors would give in and give them a dose of morphine and send
                        them away. Sure that was faster, but ethically she still couldn’t do it. Perhaps that’s why she
                        had longer care times than the other doctors.</p>
