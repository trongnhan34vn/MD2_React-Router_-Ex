          <p>I inadvertently went to See's Candy last week (I was in the mall looking for phone repair), and as it turns
            out, See's Candy now charges a dollar -- a full dollar -- for even the simplest of their wee confection
            offerings. I bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolate-caramel-almond things. The total cost was
            four-something. I mean, the candies were tasty and all, but let's be real: A Snickers bar is fifty cents.
            After this dollar-per-candy revelation, I may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a See's Candy any
            time soon.</p>
          <p>The choice was red, green, or blue. It didn't seem like an important choice when he was making it, but it
            was a choice nonetheless. Had he known the consequences at that time, he would likely have considered the
            choice a bit longer. In the end, he didn't and ended up choosing blue.</p>
